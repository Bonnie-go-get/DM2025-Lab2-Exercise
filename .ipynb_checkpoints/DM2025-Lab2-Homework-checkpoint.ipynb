The `first two phases` refer to the `exercises inside the Master notebooks` of the [DM2025-Lab2-Exercise Repo](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise.git). The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",

    "- **Phase 1 exercises:** Need GPU for training the models explained in that part, if you don't have a GPU in your laptop it is recommended to run in Colab or Kaggle for a faster experience, although with CPU they can still be solved but with a slower execution.\n",
    "- **Phase 2 exercises:** We use Gemini's API so everything can be run with only CPU without a problem.\n",
    "- **Phase 3 exercises:** For the competition you will probably need GPU to train your models, so it is recommended to use Colab or Kaggle if you don't have a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n",
    "- **Optional Ollama Notebook (not graded):** You need GPU, at least 4GB of VRAM with 16 GB of RAM to run the local open-source LLM models. \n",

    "The pie chart shows an imbalance amount in different emotion classes. Almost half of the texts in the train_df is 'joy'. 'disgust' and 'fear' contribute the smallest proportion in the dataset records. This imbalance may lead to overpredict joy and underperform the rare emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most text lengths are in the range around 5 to 30. The **BERT, CNN** or transformer models may work with this dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The texts can be preprocessed by **lowercase, remove the punctuation, and normalize the whitespace**.  \n",
    "Because of the imbalance, I also try with **oversampling** for classical models and **class weigth** for deep learning. I hope this dealing with imbalance may help improve the model performance.  \n",
    "For feature engineering, I try with **BOW, TF-IDF**\n",
    "\n",
    "The train_df is splitted into new train and validated dataframe using train_test_split, and then are gone into training with different models. Each trained model performance is evaluated based on the accuracy, recall and F1-score.\n",
    "Models I try to train the dataset on are: **Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I use the unpreprocessed data, BOW with the Logistic Regression as the baseline, and try on other preprocessed, imbalance handling, other feature engineering and other models after that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I use the final trained model to predict the emotion labels for the unseen test dataset, which is separated from the merged_df. Also, I create the final submission.csv file by combining the 'id' from the test_df with the predicted emotion labels from the previous step."
